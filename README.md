# Calculadora_BF_IMC_etc
  
  - My wife needed a simple app to calculate some patient measurements,
so i developed as best i could a rudimentary app to calculate body fat and other things, hope you like it.
the code is not so clean, but it is working.

  - I used the library PySimpleGUI to make a friendly interface.
  - I hope to be able to optmize the app over time.
